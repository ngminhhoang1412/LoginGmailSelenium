## Requirement
Must have Python <= 3.9 and Google Chrome installed.

## Usage
```pycon
pip install login_gmail_selenium
```
And then on example.py
```pycon
from login_gmail_selenium.util.profile import ChromeProfile

profile = ChromeProfile(email, password, backup_email)
# To allow downloads add insecure=True to ChromeProfile
# To handle false email with custom functions, use param false_email_callback
driver = profile.retrieve_driver()
profile.start()
# Do whatever with driver afterward
driver.get('https://www.google.com/')
...
```
1. Add folder extension/ if you want custom extensions for Chrome (.crx or .zip)
2. The temp folder's content will be generated by the library
Your folder should look like this
```cvs
/temp
    /profiles
        /profile1
        /profile2
/extension
    /custom_extension
        extension1.zip
        extension2.crx
example.py
```

## Upload to pypi

1. Organize your code into proper file hierarchy
2. Add a LICENSE and a README.md if not already done

```cvs
/demopackage
    __init__.py
    demopackage.py
    /demosubpackage
      __init__.py
      demosubpackage.py
    /tests
        test_package.py
LICENSE
setup.py
```
3. Create (if not have) and update version number on setup.py

4. Generate distribution archive files

```pycon
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
This should create a dist/ and build/ folder in your main directory with the compressed files of your package!
5. Upload your distribution archives to PyPI
```pycon
pip install --upgrade twine
twine upload dist/*
```
You will be prompted for your PyPI login credentials, and then the upload will begin. 
Now you should be able to log in to your PyPI account and see your package.
